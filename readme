To change background music:

Add your audio files (MP3, OGG, WAV) to the same folder as the HTML file
Edit the playlist - find this line near the top of the script:

const MUSIC_PLAYLIST = [];  // Empty = no music controls shown

Change it to:

const MUSIC_PLAYLIST = ['song1.mp3', 'song2.mp3', 'track3.ogg'];
