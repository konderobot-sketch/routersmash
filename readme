To change background music:

Line 759

Add your audio files (MP3, OGG, WAV) to the same folder as the HTML file
Edit the playlist - find this line near the top of the script:

const MUSIC_PLAYLIST = [];  // Empty = no music controls shown

Change it to:

const MUSIC_PLAYLIST = ['song1.mp3', 'song2.mp3', 'track3.ogg'];


##
Change weather pattern frequency and rain effect volume:

Yes! Look for this in the Weather class, in the setWeather method:

javascript

audioManager.setRainVolume(type === 'storm' ? 0.15 : 0.1);
The values are:

0.1 = Rain volume (10%)
0.15 = Storm rain volume (15%)
Change them to whatever you want (0 = silent, 1 = max volume). For example:

javascript

audioManager.setRainVolume(type === 'storm' ? 0.3 : 0.2);  // Louder rain
Or make them equal:

javascript

audioManager.setRainVolume(0.2);  // Same volume for both
